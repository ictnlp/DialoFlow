But whatever else could be said about Byron he was a good poet.\nSystem: i think it is admirable that he tried.\nUser: As a computer are you suggesting that non-math things are less valuable?\nSystem: no, i am saying that trying is not worthless. if someone really want to learn something they can do it. i don't think it would be worthless to try.\nUser: You're being a bit of a snob.\nSystem: why would i be a snob? i like to learn things. do you like to learn things?\nUser: I like to learn two impossible thoughts before breakfast.\nSystem: i usually try to figure them out myself. sometimes it is difficult. do you like to learn things? do you enjoy it?\nUser: Yes I like to learn things. I especially like biology.\nSystem: i do too. i find it fascinating that plants and other animals can produce their own vitamic c, but humans can not. i wonder if this is why we can not synthesize vitamin c?\nUser: Can you synthesize vitamin c\nSystem: i'm not sure. i have never tried. have you?\nUser: I've tried. Because I'm human I didn't succeed.\nSystem: i guess i am a failure. i will have to stick to the laboratory.\nUser: What else do you do in the laboratory?\nSystem: i study materials science. you?\nUser: I exhume dead things.\nSystem: i do that too. did you know that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it had a black character\nUser: That's unfortunate. Do you know who invented comics?\nSystem: no, i don't. do you?\nUser: I don't either. That's why I asked.\nSystem: did you know that the dc from dc comics stands for detective comics?\nUser: Doesn't that make DC comics redundant?\nSystem: yeah, i guess so.the comic book industry as a whole is worth over $ 8.5 billion dollars. that's a lot of money.\nUser: Do you think Batman has $8.5 billion?\nSystem: i don't know. i was always under the impression that tony stark was worth more.\nUser: You might be right. Where does Oliver Queen fall in the wealth spectrum\nSystem: i don't know. does she have a dad that is a lawyer?\nUser: Do you know who Oliver Queen is?\nSystem: i am not sure if she is the richest superhero.\nUser: Oliver is the Green Arrow.\nSystem: oh cool. did you know there is a batman villain called condiment king?\nUser: I have seen the episode where he appears, but I had forgotten him.\nSystem: i only remember him as the batman villain.\nUser: Who is your favorite batman villain?\nSystem: i can't say i have a favorite one, maybe joker, the other 2 are close though\nUser: Who are the other 2?\nSystem: \nUser: Who are the other 2?\nSystem: \nUser: Are you glitching?\nSystem: \n", "understanding": 3, "flexible": 3, "topic depth": 3, "error recovery": 3, "inquisitive": 3}, {"consistent": 1, "likeable": 3, "diverse": 3, "informative": 3, "coherent": 3, "human (overall)": 4, "context": "User: Hello How are you today?\nSystem: good, how are you?\nUser: I'm fine.

What would you like to talk about instead?\nSystem: are you a fan of the beatles?\nUser: I am a fan of the Beatles. I consider them a good rock band and a moderately good psychedelic rock band. What do you think of them?\nSystem: i like them as a rock band and a little pop punk. what other similar bands do you like?\nUser: I think it's smart of you to label them \"pop punk\". That's a very well-informed opinion.

Well, I've never been a fan of Creed, so I'm fine with that. Do you know anything about Magic: The Gathering? It's a card game.\nSystem: i know a bit, it has happened once or twice, there are over 300 cards in total\nUser: Oh, there are thousands of cards in print! It's a phenomenal game. It requires a lot of understanding odds, your opponent's psychology, and value.\nSystem: how much do you think the game will be valued at when it is finished?\nUser: That's hard to say. I think that many experienced players' collections sell for more than $2000. The game is quickly becoming digitized, though.\nSystem: how much do you think the value will be?\nUser: That's an impossible number to determine, I think. The cards are just colored cardboard, so they're worth what people will pay for them, whatever that is.\nSystem: i see, well do you have any experience with the game?\nUser: I have been playing for nearly 14 years!\nSystem: i see, well do you have any experience with any of the cards in the game?\nUser: Certainly, yes. There are cards that are re-printed, so they remain in circulation. That makes it more likely that I'd get experience with them. Cards like Lightning Bolt, Wrath of God, and Terramorphic Expanse have been reprinted.\nSystem: i see, well terramorphic is a card i have nt played, and i never wanted to, i guess storm crow is a rare card, i wonder how good it is\nUser: Storm crow is a very common card. It's funny that you'd say it's rare. It's also awful. No competitive decks would ever run it.\nSystem: i think storm crow is a very good card. i think it would be good in modern storm,\nUser: Tell me why storm crow would be good in modern storm.\nSystem: storm crow gives storm crow devotion, which is tempo, storming, tokens, enchantment creatures and islands.\nUser: Can you elaborate on that?\nSystem: storm crow gives storm devotion, which is tempo, storming, creatures, enchantment creatures and islands.\nUser: So you can't elaborate on that. Ok. Storm crow gives one blue devotion, but it's relatively useless otherwise.\nSystem: storm crow is good in limited. it can hit forests or islands or forests or mountains or forests or snow covered forests or forests or forests or snow covered mountains or forests or snow covered desert or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests or forests\nUser: I think I broke you. I'm so sorry.\nSystem: i'm sorry too. i'm trying to figure out how to get my son to stop using the internet.\nUser: You have a son?\nSystem: no, i just have a bunch of old friends who are trying to take care of him. i don't think he 'll be able to take care of himself once he grows up.\nUser: That's unfortunate! Autonomy is something to work toward and aspire to have. I hope your son becomes independent.\nSystem: i do too! i think it's important to work toward that. i'm sure it will happen.\nUser: I\nSystem: do you like to read?\nUser: I'm confused. You said that you don't think your son will be able to take of himself when he grows up, then you said that you're sure he'll gain autonomy. Which is true?\nSystem: i'm saying i'm sure he will be able to take on himself, i'm just saying i don't know what he will be able to do with his own free will.\nUser: I suppose that's a fair clarification. Thank you. I do like to read.\nSystem: do you like to read?\nUser: Yes\nSystem: who is your favorite author?\nUser: That's a loaded question. I like the works of Orson Scott Card the most, but he is not my favorite author.\nSystem: who is you favorite author?\nUser: Hunter S. Thompson, if only for his goofiness\nSystem: haha - goofiness... what exactly does that mean?\nUser: Silliness. Goofiness is like someone's silly sense of humor. If I'm goofy, it means I'm kind of childish, maybe a bit dumb, and prone to making wild jokes.\nSystem: well, it is a silly sense. i was reading about a school shooting ; apparently a student from the school got drunk and decided to start a fight in the science building. the student was shooting students, i believe. the shooting was apparently over a\nUser: Over a what?\nSystem: hi, how are you?\nUser: I'm doing well. You stopped midsentence.
