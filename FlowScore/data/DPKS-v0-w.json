I picked the apples my own apple trees!\nSystem: Wow. I wish I had time to grow my own apples.\nUser: Yeah it is a lot of work, every fall you have to pick so many of them.\nSystem: You are so dedicated! it is so nice talking to someone so into their apple trees.\nUser: Thank you! I even press apple cider from those apples. One year I got one hundred gallons!\nSystem: Wow! I bet you had a huge supply of apples.\nUser: Oh yeah, there were so many! It took weeks to pick and wash them all.\nSystem: I bet you were so happy to get the fresh apples.\nUser: I was very happy, the pie and cider always tastes better when you make it yourself. Just like you said about brownies.\nSystem: I bet the apple cider pies and Brownies taste great too.\nUser: The pies and cider definitely did, I'll have to try making brownies and see ow they turn out.\nSystem: Brownies are one of the top 3 desserts in America. You should give it a try\nUser: Impressive, I definitely will sometime. What other hobbies do you have other than cooking?\nSystem: Well I'm a professional Baker. do you like to Bake?\nUser: That's cool, I do sometimes make pies but that's pretty much it.\nSystem: You should learn how to Bake as well. It is very easy once you get the hang of it.\nUser: Yeah maybe I'll try to bake more, when I have time of course. \nSystem: Cooking is a luxury, baking is a necessity. have you ever tried baking your own clothes?\nUser: No, what happens when you bake clothes?\nSystem: Nothing happens, they just look like regular clothes. do you enjoy cooking?\nUser: Ha nice, I kind of thought that they would catch on fire! I do enjoy cooking but I usually don't have time to cook unfortunately.\nSystem: Cooking is a luxury in modern society, it is definitely best enjoyed in small amounts.\nUser: Yeah I agree on that. I like it when other people cook for me too so hopefully I can find someone who likes to do that for me.\nSystem: I hope you find someone who enjoys cooking with you.\nUser: Thank you, that made me smile!\nSystem: It made me smile too! we need more people willing to share the joy of cooking with others!\nUser: Yes we do! Cooking is great, and then you can enjoy the fruits of you labor by eating it!\nSystem: I would love to eat the fruits of my own labor.\nUser: Yeah I bet you would, may that be possible someday.\nSystem: It should be, because everyone deserves to eat what they produce.\nUser: Yes they do. Hey I've got to go now, it's been great talking with you! Maybe I'll see you again sometime!\nSystem: Maybe, maybe not. I'm glad we have something in common though, I like talking about cooking.\nUser: Yeah me too, best of luck to you!\nSystem: You too.

Isn't science amazing? Also, the occupation of court jester was invented accidentally, when a vassal's epilepsy was mistaken for capering.\nSystem: So I'm not alone with my teeth dreams? Wow, that's interesting!\nUser: You definitely are not. Halley's Comet can be viewed orbiting Earth every seventy-six years. For the other seventy-five, it retreats to the heart of the sun, where it hibernates undisturbed.\nSystem: The Comet is a big deal. It's been in the sky most of the days that I've been alive?\nUser: Me too. It was a pleasure talking to you :)\nSystem: I wish we had more time together.
