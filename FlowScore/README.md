## Flow Score

**Flow Score** is an automatic reference-free evaluation metric for interactive dialogue evaluation based on the pre-trained DialoFlow.

As the **DialoFlow** is trained on human-human dialogues, the context flow scheme can be regarded as the general expectation of the dialogue development. Therefore, the closer gap between the semantic influence brought by the chatbotâ€™s utterance and the expectation means the more human-likeness. 

## How to use?

```python
from flow_score import *
MODEL_PATH = "models/DialoFlow_large.bin"
FLOW_SCORE = FlowScore(MODEL_PATH)
dialogues = ["hello", "Hi there. tell me about yourself.", "Well I'm a college student who loves learning about the world around me!"]
flow_score = FLOW_SCORE.score(dialogues)
```

## Data

We use the dialogues from the Interactive Evaluation of Dialog Track @ DSTC9. The dialogues are from 11 different chatbots. 

Please cite DSTC9 paper if you use the data.
