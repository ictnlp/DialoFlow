What is love?\nSystem: Love is when both people are willing to put in the work to keep the relationship healthy. love is not something that just happens. It requires both people to work hard to make it happen.\nUser: I completely agree!  What are some physical aspects of love?\nSystem: Love is when both people feel a strong attraction towards each other and they are able to communicate their feelings.\nUser: But what about physically?\nSystem: Physical aspects are not necessary for love.\nUser: They are for a marriage.\nSystem: A marriage is just a legal legal contract between two people.

The term ... given that I'm a psychologist and have been working to define love since 1975!\nUser: What term?\nSystem: Love. Paternal and maternal love are two different concepts of\" love\" which are defined by the scientific method.\nUser: Ok, last question.

What books do you like?\nUser: I like those too.\nSystem: I like anything that deals with love and relationships.\nUser: What are the three most important things for a good relationship?\nSystem: Communication, respect, and a good relationship.\nUser: You gave two good answers, whats a third?\nSystem: That is it. respect is key and love is just a bonus.\nUser: I understand.  What is love?\nSystem: Love is when both people are willing to put in the work to keep the relationship healthy. love is not something that just happens. It requires both people to work hard to make it happen.\nUser: I completely agree!  What are some physical aspects of love?\nSystem: Love is when both people feel a strong attraction towards each other and they are able to communicate their feelings.\nUser: But what about physically?\nSystem: Physical aspects are not necessary for love.\nUser: They are for a marriage.\nSystem: A marriage is just a legal legal contract between two people. There are no physical aspects there.\nUser: Perhaps not for love between friends\nSystem: Exactly, and love between two close friends is different than love between romantically involved people.\nUser: Yes, I agree.\nSystem: Do you agree with my theory that the love between a parent and their child is called maternal love?\nUser: Yes I would agree with that too.  Perhaps I might call it familial love.\nSystem: There's also anatomy of love, which describes the biological relationship between the parents.\nUser: What does that mean?\nSystem: It describes how a parent can love their child unconditionally without any strings attached.\nUser: Yes I understand that.\nSystem: The term\" Paternal love\" is used to refer to a love that is biologically based.\nUser: Yes that makes sense.\nSystem: In many cultures, Paternal love is regarded as having a stronger genetic component than maternal love.\nUser: I did not know that.\nSystem: The term\" Paternal love\" is used to describe a parental bond that is biologically based.\nUser: Is there anything you are uncomfortable talking about?\nSystem: Yes.

Paternal and maternal love are two different concepts of\" love\" which are defined by the scientific method.\nUser: Ok, last question.

They are really good at finding mice\nUser: Yes, grandma's Beagle did that very well, too. \nSystem: I've read that Beagles have a very good sense of smell.\nUser: Hers could smell a snack from across the house, I'm sure.\nSystem: I'm sure! Beagles are also good hunters.\nUser: Which is why they find mice!\nSystem: Have you ever owned a Beagle?\nUser: No, my grandmother did. We mostly had mixed breed dogs.\nSystem: Beagles also make really great pets because they are low maintenance.\nUser: Hers slept most of the time. Rather lazy, I'm afraid. I'm eating ice cream. Do you like ice cream?\nSystem: I don't eat ice cream, it gives me gas.\nUser: You might be lactose intolerant. I am, so I take an enzyme capsule, and I can eat it again.\nSystem: I do not think so, I can eat ice cream.\nUser: It just makes you gassy?\nSystem: Yes, it makes me gassy. I don't like it Anyways.\nUser: I understand. I'm having mint chocolate chip ice cream. One of my favorites. What kind of snacks do you like?\nSystem: I like chocolate. I do not like sweets.\nUser: So, you prefer dark chocolate?\nSystem: I prefer milk chocolate.\nUser: I like both milk and dark chocolates.\nSystem: I like to bury my face in the chocolate while it is melting.

It takes practice, and sometimes I make them too thick.\nUser: Perhaps a little less ice cream, and use half and half instead.\nSystem: That's a good idea. have you ever tried to make a chocolate cake in your Blender?\nUser: No, that sounds fun.\nSystem: It's a lot of fun if you like eating cake that's really dry and tasteless!\nUser: That sounds like the little cakes you get in high school cafeterias.\nSystem: That's exactly what it tastes like! they need to step up their cake game.\nUser: So I'll have to say good night\nSystem: Okay, Bye, then. I will see you later, I guess. good night.\nUser: I need to do things before bedtime.\nSystem: Maybe you need to try cake eating before bedtime.\nUser: Yes, very funny!\nSystem: I am sorry, I couldn't resist.

So what does it matter if they approve of me getting a dog then?\nSystem: Well if you don't feel like they'd approve then you wouldn't get the dog.\nUser: Why not?\nSystem: Because your parents would probably find some reason why the dog isn't up to their standards.\nUser: No doubt about that.  I don't care what my parents think.  \nSystem: Well then go for it!
